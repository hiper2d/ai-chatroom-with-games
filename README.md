My idea is to crete a chatroom where a human can play text-based games with multiple AI bots. Bots should not be aware of each other, then think that they everybody else a humans.

The task is not trivial because popular frameworks and APIs require to define who is writing a message (Human or AI).
Below is an ugly design diagram of the idea. I'll improve it once I implemented the first version of the chatroom and see how it works. Currently, there are too many unknowns.
